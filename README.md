- 👋 Hi, I’m @10beerl, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from Brunel University - London.
- ⏮️ My previous experience is in manufacturing and general engineering practices.
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end software development and computer hardware. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and C++ through Udemy, Codecademy, Mimo and text books.
- 🎯 My target at the moment is to become fluent in c++, and then start to develop video game or processor software in this language.
